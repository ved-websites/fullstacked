usageMatchRegex:
  # The following example shows how to detect `t("your.i18n.keys")`

  # you can ignore it and use your own matching rules as well
  - "[^\\w\\d]new I18nException\\(['\"`]({key})['\"`]"

# A RegEx to set a custom scope range. This scope will be used as a prefix when detecting keys
# and works like how the i18next framework identifies the namespace scope from the
# useTranslation() hook.
# scopeRangeRegex: "new I18nException\\(\\s*\\[?\\s*['\"`](.*?)['\"`]"

# An array of strings containing refactor templates.
